    <h1>Introducing Myself</h1>
    <p><strong>Name:</strong> Ida I Dewa Agung Angga Saputra</p>
    <p><strong>Class:</strong> X-B</p>
    <p><strong>Student Number:</strong> 16</p>
    <p>My idol is Soeharto, the second President of Indonesia. He was born on June eighth, nineteen twenty-one, in Yogyakarta. He led the country from nineteen sixty-seven to nineteen ninety-eight. Soeharto was known as a quiet, disciplined, and strong leader. He focused on stability, economic growth, and development. One of his major achievements was the Green Revolution, which helped improve agriculture in Indonesia. He also built roads, schools, and supported national development. Soeharto had a round face, short black hair, and often wore a military uniform. I admire him because of his strong leadership and dedication to improving Indonesia.</p>
